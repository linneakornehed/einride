We will also create new jobs in terms of maintaining the infrastructure, and safety checking the systems as well as the T-Pod. 
                                    Our first estimation is that we will need approximately 200 employees, which includes drivers, IT developers, production engineers and lawyers. In this way we are also creating new jobs.
